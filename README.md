These are deep learning projects that I implemented in Python. Each project folder includes the complete source code along with a README and a requirements.txt file. 

## Project Overviews
- Mixed Precision Training: Uses both low and half-precision to train a BIGNET model.
- Image Compressor and Generator: Compresses images using an autoenconder and autoregressive methods. Also generates samples of the compressed images.
- Vision Language Model: Generates QA pairs from the SuperTux dataset. The QA pairs are used for training, where the model is then evaulated based on its answer accuracy.
- Fine Tuned Large Langugae Model: Uses the methods referred to as supervised fine-tuning (sft) and reinforcement fine-tuning (rft) to fine tune a large language model.

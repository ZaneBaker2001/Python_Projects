# Deep Learning Projects (Python)
Each project is self-contained with complete source code, a README, and a requirements.txt file for easy setup.

🔁 Mixed Precision Training
Implements mixed precision to accelerate training of a BIGNET model.

Utilizes both low and half-precision formats to reduce memory usage and improve training speed without compromising accuracy.

🖼️ Image Compressor and Generator
Compresses images using a combination of autoencoders and autoregressive models.

Also supports sample generation from compressed representations, effectively functioning as a generative image model.

📷🗣️ Vision-Language Model
Generates question-answer pairs from the SuperTux dataset.

Trains a multimodal model and evaluates its answer accuracy, showcasing vision-language understanding and integration.

🧠 Fine-Tuned Large Language Model
Fine-tunes a large language model using both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT).

Demonstrates advanced language model customization for downstream tasks.
